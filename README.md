Welcome to My project on
Android Arduino Bluetooth connection 
=============
For begineers who want to use their bluetooth transciever
for wireless data transmission with an Android app:

This is an example of how to connect an Arduino with a Bluetooth transciever to an Android app.

I connected the Arduino board with a temperature sensors along with the bluetooth module.

The tempareture sensor collects the information and transmits the information using bluetooth.

The Android app is paired with the bluetooth transciever module and then

The Android app receives the temperature information from the board via bluetooth.
